# Polonium.exe
My first GDI malware.
I wrote it a little bit scribbled.
The name"Polonium"means"The chemical symbol Po, with atomic number 84, is one of the rarest elements known, with a content of about 1 part per trillion in the earth's crust, mainly obtained by artificial synthesis. Polonium elemental is a silvery-white metal that emits light in the dark. Discovered in 1898 by Marie Curie and her husband Pierre Curie, the duo named polonium in honour of Marie Curie's native Poland. Polonium is one of the most toxic substances in the world."
